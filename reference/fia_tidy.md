# Read in and join all required tables

Reads in all the tables needed for carbon estimation and population
scaling and joins them into a single table. Then, some additional data
cleaning steps are performed.

1.  Creates unique tree and plot identifiers (`tree_ID` and `plot_ID`,
    respectively).

2.  Fills in missing values for `ACTUALHT` with values from `HT` to
    prepare for interpolation.

3.  Overwrites `SPCD` with whatever the last value of `SPCD` is for each
    tree (to handle trees that change `SPCD`).

4.  Fills a tree's `MORTYR` column so every row contains the recorded
    mortality year.
