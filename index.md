# forestTIME

This R package contains functions to create annualized versions of FIA
data. It can download raw FIA data from DataMart, merge required tables,
interpolate between surveys, and re-estimate biomass and carbon from
interpolated values. The output is a single dataframe with values for
every tree in every year rather than the original panel design.

## Installation

`forestTIME` is not on CRAN.

To install from r-universe:

``` r

install.packages("forestTIME", repos = c("https://cct-datascience.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

To install from GitHub:

``` r

#install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Evans-Ecology-Lab/forestTIME")
```

## I just want the data!

If you just want to download annualized FIA tables produced by
`forestTIME.builder`, head over to the most recent
[release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17088642) on Zenodo to download
parquet files. They can be read into R as dataframes with `nanoparquet`,
for example.
